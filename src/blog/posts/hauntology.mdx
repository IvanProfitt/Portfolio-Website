## Jacques Derrida's Hauntology
The term *Hauntology* was first coined by Jacques Derrida, in his book "*Specters of Marx*." Derrida's concept of Hauntology explores the relationship between the past, the present, and the future - although through an explicitly political lens; drawing the word hauntology from the first sentence of *The Communist Manifesto* "There is a spectre haunting Europe," Derrida analyzes the previously imagined futures of Marxist revolution - futures, as we know, were unsuccessful. 

These pasts and promised futures, according to Derrida, still continue to haunt us. Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the falling of the Berlin wall, [the end of history](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57981.The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man), we are still embroiled with the writings of Marx. This specter is still haunting us; even if it no longer exists, the specter was never informed of its nonexistence, so it persists.  
## Nostalgia for the Future
At first glance, this phrase seems nonsensical. How can we have nostalgia for something that hasn't happened? The answer, to me, takes several steps to approach an answer. The first step - the future does not exist.
### The Future is Canceled. 
In a literal, temporal sense, of course there is a future - but culturally, do we have any illusions of our future that are significantly different from our present? We may have visions of a post-apocalypse or dystopia; there is no shortage of culturally relevant original media franchises that exist in such a setting (The Walking Dead, The Hunger Games, Fallout, Max Max, etc.).

This isn't simply a coincidence, this is a product of the cultural and philosophical state of the 21st century. We are no longer able to envision a better future for ourselves because we are caught in a moment of continual repetition and nostalgia. Instead of creating new movies, music, books, we simply continue to interpolate the media of the past. 

Let's take of the top 10 grossing movies so far in the 2020s. 7 of them are explicit sequels, two are movies based on decades-old franchises, and the last is a biopic based on a historical figure. There are no newly established stories, just a recycling of the past. This is what is meant by the cancelation of the future - there is nothing original being made for wide public consumption. We are given recycled media; unoriginal and uninspired. 

Take music, for example. The top genres of this century are pop, rock, and hip hop. Pop and rock have produced the same tracks for decades: take any modern day song and bring it to someone living in the 1990s and they would find it entirely plausible that it was made during their time period. Hip hop, however, is an even more direct example of recycling previously made culture - in fact, it is an explicit cornerstone of the genre. 
### The Future of the Past

Haunting not only comes from the past, but also the future - according to Derrida. Time is not a linear order of pasts influencing present, but rather the present is always being influenced by both the past and the future simultaneously. Time is very interconnected in Derrida's philosophy: The past, present, or future cannot be explained in isolation, they all require one another to exist. Possible futures influence our present and certainly the unrealized futures of the past continue to haunt us. 

In past decades, there were many versions of the future. Flying cars, Mars colonies, futuristic city plans - none of which came to fruition. The past found amazement in the possibilities of tomorrow, now we are resigned to the sameness of today. When thinking about the future, is there anything radically different in your imagination than what today's world looks like? If anything, we are still holding on to these past visions of the future, clinging on to them as a sort of prophecy. We want the future to be different than our present, but don't know how.

The latest haunting from our future seems to come from the emergence of AI technology. Companies are so haunted by this possible future that they are investing billions to come out ahead, just in case this vision of the future is true.  I see it as another fad, another NFT or Web 3.0 that will have nowhere near the impact that the most vocal supporters wish it did. Nonetheless, this possible future continues to haunt our present - companies are laying off employees in favor of AI chatbots or code generation software, but eventually will come to the realization that the technology is simply not there.
