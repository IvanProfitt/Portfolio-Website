### A much larger challenge than I expected.

## Technologies Used

My blog is built on a foundation of React. Why React, if it is a static site? Future proofing. I have many plans that involve implementing a backend
(comments, in-browser applications, etc.) and I want to be able to do so without having to rewrite the entire site. Starting on a React foundation
also allows me to test some libraries I've been interested in - For this blog specifically, I have used [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/), 
as well as integrated [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for the blog posts. This allows me to write blog posts in markdown, which makes them easier 
to read and write. I am using Vite as my build tool, but am looking into switching to Next.JS. 

## Why Did I Build It From Scratch?

I built this blog from scratch as a learning exercise. I wanted to experiment with Material UI, as well as interact with interesting Libraries.

The resurgence of the Indie Web inspired me to begin this project - after seeing so many others create blogs for themselves, I wanted to do the same.
Most of these websites are coded in plain HTML/CSS, which is great for their purposes - but not as useful for mine. Simply put, I want to have experience
in using the tech that I want to work with professionally. 


## Challenges
My largest challenge was with working with MDX. It is not a very widely-used library, so there is little to go off of as far as resources - except,
of course, for the docs and GitHub. Most technologies I've worked with have been very well documented, so it has been a bit of a struggle to 
try and find solutions on my own - however, it has been a great learning opportunity.

### Perfectionism
I have a difficult time sharing anything unless I deem it to be perfect. Well, this just isn't the case for my blog (or my website, for that matter).
I am allowing myself to publish an unfinished project, in order to let go of achieving perfection. I will continually be updating everything, but 
I would like to showcase what I have now.

## Future Plans
I plan on adding several features to the blog, such as:
- Comments,
- A search feature,
- User analytics and view tracking,
- and more.

I plan on using this blog as a devlog for myself and my various projects, as well as a place to share my general thoughts.

I'm always looking to improve the website and will continue to do so! If you like what you see, check out my resume, or shoot me an email!
