A restaurant sits dormant, while the rest of the world continues on. It's doors shuttered, tables cleared, lights off, while in clear view to the hustle and bustle of passersby. A place of hospitality now offers nothing but hostility - a sore viewing experience for any brave enough to look. The remembrance of the atmosphere that was provided by the restaurant, is now a specter haunting the building it used to inhabit.

The specter is all-consuming, able to be perceived by everyone who enters. What are the causes of this feeling, are they able to be exorcised?



### A Brief Introduction to Liminality and Rites of Passage
There are times in ones life where you are permanently altered, transitioning from your pre-self to a post-self. Baptisms, divorcing of parents, graduation ceremonies - these events have a clear beginning, rite of passage, then end stage. One of these events have undoubtedly happened to all of us - we are aware of how they work, even if we haven't previously put a name to it. These rites of passage, according to Arnold van Genno, are performed in three stages:
	1. Preliminary
	2. Liminality
	3. Post-liminality

Preliminary and Post-liminary seem simple enough, it's the state of self before and after the event. I'm most interested in the middle state, Liminality - when one is in the middle of a rite: no longer your pre-ritual self, but also not your post-ritual self. In a state of Liminality, everything about yourself is in flux. All previously held notions, your societal role, your very existence, is in question. This is disorienting by its very nature - everything that you know is being changed, you are going to be fundamentally different on the other side. That is, if you do reach a stage of post-liminality. 


The preliminary self haunts the restaurant. Its days of operation are still clear in the minds of many. It was a place of hospitality, welcoming, happiness. The familiar sounds of a restaurant echo: the clanking of silverware, the chitchat of the customers, the hustle and bustle of servers, the popping of bottles. It was a dance done hundreds of times before, once again repeated. There was energy that permeated the entire building, creating an captivating atmosphere for all.


	Then comes a surprise meeting. We are corralled into a dark room. When entering, familiar faces from corporate offices are all around - something big is happening. The staff are told of the immediate closure of the restaurant. No explanation, sympathy, or work opportunities are given. "Feel free to apply online to any open positions" is all that they are told. In one moment, everyone is gone - the restaurant is no more. The immediate aftermath is devastating; tears, condolences from fellow former staff. The room is filled with anger, confusion, and shock. How could this have happened, with not so much as a days warning?
	
	There is a notable absence of compassion from nearly all higher-ups. In fact, there is hostility towards the former staff for not picking themselves up by their bootstraps, if only they had worked harder - maybe then they'd still have a job. Ex-staff are banned from the premises - this proclamation in some way seems to be an admission of guilt, or at least a sign of a guilty conscious. They should've cooked faster, sold higher priced items, had better service - this was completely their fault. 

A key component of liminality is the existence of a strict ritual that should be followed. In a funeral, there is a structured ceremony that has a strict beginning, middle and end. The purpose of this ritual is to aid in the transition from the pre-liminal to the post-liminal - both the individual, as well as the group. We must grapple with this large shift in our reality, rites of passage play a crucial role in this process.

Much like a funeral, there are a predetermined sequence of events that should play out for a business closure. Giving staff notice, to prepare financially and occupationally for their layoff. The ability to give final goodbyes to the people they've spent countless hours with. Managers and owners showing compassion, because failure is not one-sided. But this ritual was not performed here. 

The transition from pre-liminal to post-liminal was not properly done. Instead of making a smooth passage to the post-liminal by means of the liminal, there formed a stasis in the liminal. The environment that was created fostered a situation in which the post-liminal was never able to form. Instead, we are stuck in the liminal stage; the only thing that is certain is uncertainty.

The lack of ritual has dirtied the spirit of the restaurant. The unceremonious treatment of former employees is felt in the specter of the liminal. Negative energy permeates, the cause of which can clearly be traced back to the disregard of the ritual.  


### Non-Places
Marc Auge was an anthropologist best known for his book *Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity*. As the title suggests, this book is a study of Non-Places - a term that he coined to refer to places that could not be called "places" by their anthropological definition:

>Place comprises geographical locations and forms narratives of belonging, shaping identities and histories cross-culturally. Place is also connected to questions of adaptability and the environment. As such, the intersection of place and environment engages cultural and physical realities shaping ever-changing subsistence strategies and symbolic attachment to place.

If a place is somewhere that people can meet, connect, and engage with others, then a non-place is it's opposite. Non-places are places where an individual feels a sense of loneliness, they feel unknown and unacknowledged.  Airports are prime examples of this phenomenon.

>In the social sciences, the airport is usually analyzed as a Non-Place, a space of transience where large numbers of people pass through anonymously.

There is nothing in an airport that allows you to identify with the space. There is a homogeneity to the entire space - barren, sterile, surveilled. Nothing is identifiable, nobody is able to make personal connections to anything. The point of the space is not to harbor social interactions, but rather the opposite. The less interaction with others, the more efficient the space can be. 

The feeling of anonymity in an airport can be almost haunting. While you're in this space, you aren't quite human - rather a body being transported. 

These feelings are the opposite of what an experience at a restaurant should be - you should feel welcomed, heard, seen, and taken care of. It's the entire goal of _hospitality_. This restaurant was no different, it was filled with hardworking people doing their best to ensure you had a great experience, filled with great food, atmosphere, and conversation. 

The space that was once a restaurant is now hostile. It is dark, emptied, yet still maintains the semblance of a restaurant - a ghost town clinging to its former life. The dichotomy between the preliminary state and the current liminal uncertainty is palpable. The specter of the place's former life haunts the building, the atmosphere that is no longer present is felt stronger than ever in its absence. 

The transition from a place to a non-place was instantaneous. Like a death without a proper funeral, or so much as a burial. The corpse still in plain sight, unsettling for all who view it. Everybody has a different remembrance of the restaurant, but one thing remains unchanged - the ambiance of hospitality it provided. 


Many people agree that there is a negative energy in the building. The solution? A ritual. Maybe this ritual can force the space into a post-liminal stage, one where the place is no longer in a state of unrest - maybe the non-place will once again become a place. Sage is burned, a ritual is performed, hopefully correctly. But, the post-liminal has not been reached. The completion of one ritual cannot counteract the failure of another, thus nothing has changed.

There are future plans for the restaurant, so maybe one day it may feel normal again. But, will it ever rid itself of the specter of what once was? The memories cannot just be erased, painted over, and forgotten.
